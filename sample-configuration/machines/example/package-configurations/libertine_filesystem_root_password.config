# Create a salted, SHA-512 hashed password by running, say, mkpasswd --method sha512 --salt "$(curl --tlsv1.2 --silent 'https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=16&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=plain&rnd=new')"
# Be aware that in this example there's nothing to stop random.org logging your generated salt.

# eg To use a password of 'helloworld'
