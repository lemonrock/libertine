## rsyslog alternatives
- syslog to CloudWatch AWS bridge
	- https://github.com/rjocoleman/syslog-cloudwatch-bridge
	- would work as a local forwarding agent
	- written in Go; need to add go bootstrap
	- but would use the older format
- Using socat, but might not work https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/267118/socat-netcat-udp-to-tcp#267134
	- and would log with older RFC format, too
- ubox logread / logd
	- https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/ubox.git;a=tree;f=log;hb=HEAD
	- introduces ubus, which we don't want
	- still needs stunnel
- Kiwi - too complex
- graylog
- nxlog
- syslog-ng OSE

## Web Services
- logentries.com can work with old fashioned syslog but rsyslog with tagging is preferred
	- https://www.loggly.com/docs/rsyslog-tls-configuration/
	- https://www.loggly.com/docs/rsyslog-manual-configuration/
	- Streaming w/o files: https://www.loggly.com/docs/streaming-syslog-without-using-files/
	- Can work with syslog, but needs TLS and TCP, and BusyBox syslogd just uses raw UDP
- loggly.com really requires rsyslog
- api.logmatic.io - rsyslog / TLS+TCP+Structured
- scalyr - uses an agent
	- forget it
- https://papertrailapp.com/ - TLS+TCP+Structured
	- bootstrap start up plans
- logsene - old fashioned syslog but prefers a JSON format....
	- forget it

## Self-Host
- graylog
	- sadly, written in Java so only really suitable for deployment on Heroku
- fluentd
